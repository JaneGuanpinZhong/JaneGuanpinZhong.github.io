<div class="textblock"><h1>Welcome to Mia!</h1>
<p>Hi! This is a tutorial for users like you to learn more about <b>Mia</b> application and how to use it. Basically it discusses loading images and annotating them. Please go through it step by step, and you can also manipulate the application at the same time.</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><b>Mia</b> is a medical imaging analysis application with filters and special tools. It can be used to edit medical images and make some special marks.</p>
<p>Firstly we are going to load a image to the buffer, since loading files is one of the most important usages of Mia application. Here we use an X-ray teeth image as an example.</p>
<h2>Open a file</h2>
<p>You can open a picture through clicking <b>Open</b> button, then choosing a file from a local folder. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/teeth.png"/>
</div>
<h2>Save a file</h2>
<p>You can save any picture with or without edition by clicking <b>Save</b> button, then choosing a folder and naming the image. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/opensave.png"/>
</div>
<h2>Undo</h2>
<p>You can undo any behavior through clicking <b>Undo</b> button.</p>
<h2>Redo</h2>
<p>You can undo any behavior through clicking <b>Redo</b> button. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/undoredo.png"/>
</div>
<p><b>After loading the image to the buffer, we can choose tools and filters to annotate them.</b></p>
<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>We have two tools "mark" and "pen", and they are introduced below.</p>
<h2>Pen</h2>
<p>This tool is designed to look like a pen. It makes an opaque, circular mark with constant intensity. This means that when the pen is applied to the canvas the digital ink from the pen completely covers any color that had previously been applied to the canvas at that position. The color of the pen can be set interactively using the GUI.</p>
<p>For example, here we circle the areas which we want to emphasize. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/penteeth.png"/>
</div>
<h2>Mark</h2>
<p>It is a red stamp that can emphasize some areas of the images, so that other users can see them as well. It increases the efficiency of the assessment for patients.</p>
<p>For example, here we put the stamps at the areas which we want to emphasize. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/markteeth.png"/>
</div>
<h1>Filters</h1>
<h2>Threshold Filter</h2>
<p>Each of the color channels will be rounded up to the maximum value of 1.0 or down to the minimum value of 0.0 based on whether the pixelâ€™s value is greater or less than the GUI input value, respectively. Below is the result using cutoff value of 0.5. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/threshold0.5teeth.png"/>
</div>
<h2>Quantize Filter</h2>
<p>Reduce the number of colors in the image by binning. If using 4 bins, there will only be 4 possible intensity values for each color channel, spaced evenly: 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100%. Adjust each color channel value R, G, and B to put it into the nearest bin. Below is the result using number of bins of 5. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/quantize5teeth.png"/>
</div>
<h2>Blur Filter</h2>
<p>Use a Gaussian Blur image convolution kernel to blur the image in proportion to the amount specified in the GUI. Below is the result using blur amount of 5. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/blur5teeth.png"/>
</div>
<h2>Sharpen Filter</h2>
<p>Sharpen the image (accentuate the edges of shapes) in proportion to the amount specified in the GUI by convolving the image with an appropriate sharpening kernel. Below is the result using amount of 5. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/sharpen5teeth.png"/>
</div>
<h2>Edge Detection Filter</h2>
<p>Transform the image into one that only shows the edges of shapes by convolving it with a 3x3 edge detection kernel. Pixels on the border of differently colored regions will be bright, while pixels in areas of low change will be dark. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/edgeteeth.png"/>
</div>
<h2>Another button: Tool color</h2>
<p>You can choose your color for tools here. </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/toolcolor.png"/>
</div>
<h1>Command Line mode</h1>
<p>Mia has an interesting characteristic, that it can be manipulated by command lines. You can just type something in the terminal, and immediately get the output image file at the corresponding directory.</p>
<p>You can go to build/bin/mia after you make it, and then type the image you want to edit, whatever filters you want to use, and the name of output image. Please notice that there can be multiple filters between the input and output, but they must be typed properly. For instance, type "-" before the filter name, and add the parameter in most cases, except "-edgedetect". Another important point is that the images must be in ".png" form, otherwise there will be errors. And also, it is good to know that the output file can exist already, so when you run those commands, there will be a new version, which will cover the old one.</p>
<p>If you do not follow those requirements, say typing illegal commands, you will get error message, which is also help message, that can suggest what you should type. Below is what you will see if you want the help message on purpose, through typing "mia -h". </p><div class="image">
<img src="../../docs/images/help.png"/>
</div>
<p>Take saturate filter as an example. Type "build/bin/mia resources/input.png
-saturate 3 resources/output.png". Hit "Enter", then you can see a new output.png in resources directory. </p><div class="image">
